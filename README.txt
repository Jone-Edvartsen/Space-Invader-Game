Game Description

  Prelude
  
   First, you combat your office mate in the ultimate space duel (when your boss is not looking, 
   or if your boss is cool, that's who you should combat). After a victor has been crowned, this
   game can be replayed as many times as desired.

   If both players are feeling adventurous, you can take it a step further by navigating with arrows 
   and pressing Enter on the button literally prompting you to take it further.

   From fierce competitors, you now have to collaborate as you are shot into space, far from the 
   confined bubble where you previously battled. They say, for the world to unite, we need an alien 
   invader. Shoot and dodge incoming asteroids and satellites, and play as a team to survive the onslaught.

   Remember to collect the green and blue power-ups!
